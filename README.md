## 📊 Analysis Overview

| Analysis Type | Location | Groups | Status | Description |
|---------------|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Volcano Plots** | `folderAll comparison_volcano_pathway/` | 6 comparisons | ✅ Complete | Differential expression/accessibility analysis |
| **Pathway Analysis** | `folderAll comparison_volcano_pathway/` | 6 comparisons | ✅ Complete | Gene set enrichment and pathway mapping |
| **Heatmaps** | `All heatmap/` | 6 comparisons | ⚠️ Partial | Top 300 significant peaks (full dataset in progress) |

## 🔬 Analysis Details

### Volcano Plot & Pathway Analysis
- **Complete dataset**: All 6 comparison groups processed
- **Output files**: Statistical results, plots, and enrichment tables
- **Methods**: Standard differential analysis pipeline with pathway enrichment

### Heatmap Visualization
- **Current status**: Top 300 most significant peaks visualized
- **Technical limitation**: Full dataset causes R memory overflow
- **Solution in progress**: Optimizing visualization code for complete dataset

## ⚠️ Known Issues

| Issue | Impact | Workaround | Status |
|-------|--------|------------|---------|
| R memory crash | Cannot plot all peaks in heatmap | Using top 300 significant peaks | 🔄 In Progress |
| Large dataset size | Performance limitations | Subset visualization | 🔍 Investigating solutions |
